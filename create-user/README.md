# User Panel Using React âœ¨ðŸ”¥
A few days ago they sent me a technical test, I decided to do this project for myself as practice.This user panel created by react js and I used Formik and Yup for easier input validation ðŸ™‚ðŸŽˆ and I just wanted to focus on  logic so I used react bootstrap to design the whole  pages.

# pages 
 login
- register
- user panel

# Login page

as I said I didn't want to focous on the design and design take my all of times so It's a simple page for the login.
## Login Inputs
- Username 
- Email
- Password
# Register Page

as you know this page is for user register and you all of the inputs handled by the yup and formik and it maked me so easy and relax for the validation.
## register inputs
